# SchemaCrawler Ecosystem

SchemaCrawler has an emerging ecosystem. Major projects such as 
[Codenvy IDE](https://codenvy.com/) and [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com) use
SchemaCrawler, as do companies such as Software
Development Departement of [La Ville de Noumea](http://www.noumea.nc/).

However, this is a registry of plugins and extensions to SchemaCrawler.
