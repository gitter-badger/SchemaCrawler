SchemaCrawler is a free database schema discovery and comprehension tool.
SchemaCrawler has a good mix useful features for data governance. You can
[search for database schema objects](schemacrawler_grep.html) using regular
expressions, and output the schema and data in a readable text format. The
output serves for database documentation, and is designed to be 
[diff-ed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff) against other database schemas.
SchemaCrawler also generates [schema diagrams.](diagramming.html) You can
[execute scripts](scripting.html) in any standard scripting language against
your database. You can find potential schema design issues with
[lint.](lint.html)

SchemaCrawler supports almost any database that has a JDBC driver, but for
convenience is [bundled with drivers](database-support.html) for some commonly used
RDBMS systems. SchemaCrawler works with any operating system that supports
Java SE 8 or better.
